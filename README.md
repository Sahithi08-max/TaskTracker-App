A simple command-line interface (CLI) application built in Java for managing and tracking tasks in a to-do list. This project allows you to add, update, delete, mark, and list tasks with persistent storage in a JSON file.


Features
Add Tasks: Quickly add new tasks with descriptions.
Update Tasks: Edit descriptions of existing tasks.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from your list.
Mark Tasks: Update task status to "in progress," "done," or "not done."
List Tasks: View tasks based on their status (e.g., all, done, in-progress).
Persistent Storage: Stores tasks in tasks.json so data persists between sessions.
Requirements
Java: Version 8 or higher.
File System Access: tasks.json is created and stored in the project directory for persistent storage.
